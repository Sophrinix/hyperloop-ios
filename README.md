# Hyperloop for iOS âˆž [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/appcelerator/hyperloop-ios.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/appcelerator/hyperloop-ios)

Hyperloop is a next-generation compiler that converts JavaScript source code into native code for targeting different native OS platforms. 

This is the iOS backend for running Hyperloop for iOS.

## Install

#### from npm

```
[sudo] npm install -g hyperloop-ios
```

```bash
[sudo] npm install -g git://github.com/appcelerator/hyperloop-ios.git
```

#### clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/appcelerator/hyperloop-common.git

## Quick Start

Assuming you have already satisfied the [requirements](https://github.com/appcelerator/hyperloop-ios#requirements) for your target platform and installed hyperloop following the [clone and install](https://github.com/appcelerator/hyperloop-ios#clone-and-install) instructions, launching a basic example app can be done like this:

```
../hyperloop-cli/bin/hyperloop clean compile package launch --platform=ios --arch=i386 --log-level=debug --src="examples/life"
```
